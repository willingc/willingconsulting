Kudos for edX opening the technical insides of its very successful platform for development of content rich learning and course delivery. XBlock, the API, is available for viewing on GitHub <a title="Git Hub repos for edX" href="http://www.github.com/edX">http://www.github.com/edX</a>.

Keep an eye on this API opening up creation of more courses, study aids, collaboration, and customization of the learner's experience.
