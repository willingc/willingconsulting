"Lean In" is a popular saying these days. Yes, I think it is great to get more women (and underrepresented groups) into higher levels of management and more equity in tech. It's a change that I hope I see in my lifetime.

While we are "leaning", let's end the stigma about mental health. From mental health education to suicide prevention to mental health care accessibility, I want to see improvements in our world.

Just breathe... That's what I tell myself when things get a little intense or stressful. Mindfulness can make a person's world more pleasant and peaceful.

San Diego and California have been doing a great job trying to break down stigma. I love the "<a title="Up to Us Suicide Prevention Awareness" href="http://www.up2sd.org/" target="_blank">It's Up to Us</a>" program that educates and provides community resources. Young or old. Male or female.  This site is a great starting point for information.

Let me leave you with a personal challenge: "<a title="Know the Signs" href="http://www.up2sd.org/know-the-signs" target="_blank">Know the Signs</a>". You never know who you will impact. <strong>Suicide is preventable.
