As someone who teaches beginning Pythonistas to learn to program, this updated edition of the Python Pocket Reference is worth keeping close at hand.

 

The reference covers both Python 3.4 and 2.7, and it highlights changes between the two major releases in a succinct, clear way. Yes, one can find the reference information in the freely available Python docs, but this guide earns its place in my backpack by pulling together practical tips, hints, and common gotchas when using a method or function.

 

I appreciate the author including a section on the tkinter GUI module and tools. It’s helpful to have the basics in a concise format for the times that I am troubleshooting a user interface for a laboratory program or helping someone create a simple status display for an application.

 

Though it might not be the most exciting read, the Python Pocket Reference does what it does well – a straightforward, up-to-date resource for Python 3.4 and 2.7. Its hints and common idioms may also save a programmer valuable time debugging common mistakes.
