Version control and sharing source code help developers hone their craft. If you are new to developing software, learning git can seem a confusing task. In many ways, git is elegant in its simplicity and effectiveness.

When learning git, a new user has some decisions to make: use the command line or a graphical user interface; choosing where to store a remote repository; selecting a learning path that works for the developer - tutorials, video, online classes, webcasts, books, cheat sheets, or some combination. Researching these decisions complicate learning git.

Whatever your learning style, I hope this list of links to some of my favorite git resources helps you (<a title="A cheat sheet of git goodness" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ls819jfcw31qw8t/Some%20Git%20Goodness.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/8f1333n9b6syq01/Some%20Git%20Goodness.pdf</a>).
