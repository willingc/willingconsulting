<strong>Watching someone bring their idea to life is an amazing reward.</strong>

People from all walks of life have creative ideas. Through grassroots sharing of ideas, skills, and equipment, <a title="Fab Lab San Diego" href="http://fablabsd.org" target="_blank">Fab Lab San Diego</a> gives individuals a chance to learn, build, and share their creations. I believe Fab Lab San Diego's outreach programs inspire students of all ages. Outreach is hard work but the community benefits are huge.
