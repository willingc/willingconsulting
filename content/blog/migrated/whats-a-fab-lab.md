A Fab Lab is a community space for people to gather and fabricate their dreams and ideas.

A <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/faq/" target="_blank">formal definition of a Fab Lab</a> can be seen at the <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Center for Bits and Atoms</a>. The <a href="http://www.fabfoundation.org/fab-labs/" target="_blank">Fab Foundation's website</a> has a map of many Fab Labs around the world and information about the Fab Lab charter and how to start a Fab Lab.

<a href="http://www.fablabsd.org/" target="_blank">Fab Lab San Diego</a> is my little corner for inspiration and outreach. We're located in the heart of <a href="http://www.makersquarter.com/" target="_blank">Makers Quarter</a>. Here are a few links to some videos that give a good sense of Fab Lab San Diego, its mission, and its history:

Learn. Build. Share. Fab Labs and their outreach inspire individuals and build vibrant, innovative communities. I hope you visit one soon.
